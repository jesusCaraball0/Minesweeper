Minesweeper Video Game implemented using the SFML C++ Library. 
  Tile handles logic for each individual tile
  Random generates where the mines will be
  Board handles properties for the whole board
  Main runs the event loop that is the game

To run the game, install MinGW32 and SFML. Then add, the include and lib folder paths to the Makefile. Run the Makefile using mingw32-make and it should create app.exe, which opens the game when ran.
